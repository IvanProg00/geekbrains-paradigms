# Task 1

Recursive sum: Write a recursive function that calculates the sum of all numbers
from 1 to n. For example, for n = 5, the result should be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`.

Factorial: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of the number n.
The factorial of the number n is denoted as n! and is equal to the product of all
positive integers from 1 to n.
