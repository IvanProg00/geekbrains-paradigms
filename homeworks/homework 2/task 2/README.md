# Task 2

There is an array of numbers. It is necessary to divide it into subarrays so that
the sum of the numbers in each subarray is less than or equal to the specified value
of X. Why this is procedural programming: You can create a procedure that will take
an array and the value of X, and then sequentially form subarrays, following a certain
logic. This allows you to separate the process of creating each subarray into a separate
subroutine, making the main code cleaner and more understandable.
